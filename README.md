### _A tweet App_

# Problem
## Twitter isnt the same anymore!

When Twitter started its humble beginnings, it was just a simple app to compose tweets of 140 characters. But as days went by, several new features ( or distractions ) were added to Twitter. With the increasing number of distractions such as Images, Links, Advertisemnts, etc. The vanilla Twitter experience faded. Gone were the witty, sharp and funny tweets.

Kalrav is an attempt to restore Twitter back to it's glory days!

# Note

This app is currently in development and only the frontend has been done. Contributions are welcome.
